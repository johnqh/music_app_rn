/**
 * Snapshots for the open project: what the reader sees and presses.
 *
 * Every rule about snapshots is music_client's `useProjectSnapshots`, shared
 * with the web editor, and this panel only draws what it answers and calls what
 * it offers. The native copy of those rules had drifted in the way that costs
 * the most: it re-downloaded the whole project after every create and every
 * open — resetting nothing visible, but shipping the score back down each time
 * and replacing the store's score with an identical one — and suggested a
 * different public title from the web's. The rules, now upstream:
 *
 * - **Creating one flushes the live score first**, because the server copies
 *   the *projects row* and saving is debounced.
 * - **Nothing re-downloads the project.** Creating changes no music; opening
 *   hands the score back in its own response. What both change is the row's
 *   `updatedAt`, which the hook reports through `noteServerVersion` so the
 *   generation poll does not read this client's own write as a foreign one.
 * - **There is no edit or delete.** Immutability is enforced by the absence of a
 *   route. A published *title* can still change — re-publishing sets it and
 *   keeps the first `publicId`, so a shared link survives a rename.
 * - **Opening one branches rather than overwriting**; the tree is
 *   `snapshotTree`'s.
