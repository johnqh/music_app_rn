/**
 * What the panel does with `useProjectSnapshots`.
 *
 * The rules themselves — flush before creating, no re-download, the stamp
 * noted — are music_client's and tested there. What fails silently *here* is
 * the wiring between a sheet and the hook: **publishing happens in the same
 * step as creating**, because that is how the sheet asks it, and a create that
 * quietly skipped the publish would leave the reader believing their music was
 * public when it was not. Nor must a snapshot that was not asked to be public
 * become so.
