/**
 * Starting a new score, with or without a model writing it.
 *
 * The twin of the web's `NewProjectDialog`, over the same draft reducer and the
 * same two music_lib builders — so the toggle decides only which builder runs,
 * and the two apps cannot disagree about what a new project is. The state and
 * the rules live in `useNewProjectForm`, shared with the desktop Projects
 * window's inline `NewPane.tsx`; this is the modal shell around it.
 *
 * It emits a *decision*, not a project. Where that lands is the caller's: the
 * dashboard makes a project on the server, and the macOS File menu makes a
 * local document — which is why generation can be switched off entirely.
