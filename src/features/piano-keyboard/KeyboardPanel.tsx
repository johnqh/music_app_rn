/**
 * The keyboard, bound to a document.
 *
 * Pressing a key auditions it through the player and nothing else — no caret
 * move, no transport change. On release the whole group goes to `playKeyGroup`,
 * which is music_editing's: it decides whether the keys join a chord, replace a
 * selected note, or enter at the caret, and turns the held time into a note
 * value. That rule used to live inside the web app's keyboard component, which
 * is precisely why a second keyboard would have had to copy it.
 *
 * Keys pressed together are one group: a chord is keys that overlap in time, so
 * the group closes when the last finger lifts rather than the first.
