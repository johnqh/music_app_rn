/**
 * Which keys count as one chord.
 *
 * A chord is keys that overlap in time, so the group closes when the **last**
 * finger lifts, not the first — release C then press E and you have two notes;
 * hold C while pressing E and you have a third.
 *
 * Extracted from the panel because it is the one rule there worth testing, and
 * a component that owns a ref is hard to test without a renderer. What the
 * group *becomes* is music_editing's `playKeyGroup`; this only decides where
 * one group ends.
