/**
 * The playback bar, mirroring the web app's — control for control.
 *
 * Same controls in the same order, drawn with the same glyphs: go to start,
 * previous bar, play/pause, stop, next bar, loop, metronome, the bar:beat
 * readout, the tempo, the speed, the master volume, the position scrubber and
 * the timecode, with the load indicator last so it never shifts the rest.
 *
 * **The glyphs are shared, as data.** `GoToStartIcon`, `PreviousMeasureIcon`,
 * `NextMeasureIcon` and `MetronomeIcon` live in `NOTATION_ICONS` and are drawn
 * by both apps, so a metronome here is the web's metronome rather than a
 * lookalike. This bar used to draw the same `BackwardIcon` for both go-to-start
 * and previous-bar — two different actions with one picture — and a `♩` glyph
 * for the metronome.
 *
 * **Every position-driven readout is its own subscriber.** Position arrives
 * about thirty times a second; reading it here would re-render the whole bar —
 * and, through it, the notation — at that rate. The web app learned this by
 * profiling (124 renders in 4s) and split `MeasureBeatReadout`,
 * `PositionScrubber` and `Timecode` out for exactly this reason. Same split
 * here, same reason.
 *
 * **Tempo is the one control that edits the score.** Loop, metronome, speed,
 * volume and seeking are real-time device control and go to the player; the BPM
 * field is persisted with the score and goes through `commitOpeningTempoText`
 * (music_editing, the web field's own rule: blank is no change, the rest rounded
 * and bounded to the tempos the validator accepts).
 *
 * **Every control reaches the player through the binding, and every setting is
 * read back from the store.** `bindPlayer` writes loop, metronome, speed, volume
 * and the load state into the document store as it tells the player, the way
 * the web adapter writes them into the app store — so this bar holds none of
 * them in `useState` any more. It used to, which meant a second document's bar
 * showed the metronome off while the one player still ticked, and the loop it
 * set was always the whole score even with bars selected.
