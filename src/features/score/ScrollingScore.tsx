/**
 * The score in a scroll view, drawing only what is on screen.
 *
 * That windowing *is* the virtualization — the renderer draws the visible
 * systems per frame, so a 200-bar score costs what a 64-bar one does. The
 * spacer below the canvas gives the scroll view the full content size so the
 * bar behaves honestly, while the canvas itself stays viewport-sized.
 *
 * **Every geometric question goes to `ScoreCanvas`** (music_drawing, see its
 * `docs/score-canvas.md`), the same object the web editor asks: the content
 * size, what a touch landed on, the tick under it, the cursor and where
 * following playback scrolls. This component used to answer those itself and
 * disagreed with the web — its viewport and hit tests mixed logical and zoomed
 * units, so they were right only at 100%, and a touch on the spacer (already
 * in content coordinates) had the scroll offset added a second time. What is
 * left here is wiring: touches and scroll views. Which store action a hit means
 * is music_editing's, and the editor asks it.
