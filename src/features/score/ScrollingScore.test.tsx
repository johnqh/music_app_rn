/**
 * What the score view tells the canvas.
 *
 * The canvas is music_drawing's and decides everything geometric; what can go
 * wrong here is the wiring — and three pieces of it were missing on this side
 * while the web had them. Hidden tracks were still drawn, notes an instrument
 * cannot play were never marked, and the caret was a hardcoded red that
 * ignored the theme. Each is pinned against a recording canvas.
 *
 * What a touch *means* is music_editing's (`routeScorePress`,
 * `selectForContextMenu`) and is tested there; what is pinned here is that the
 * view hands those the canvas's answer, and that it tells a tap from a long
 * press from a scroll with music_drawing's `classifyPress` — a scroll that
 * happened to end over a note must not select it.
 *
 * And one thing about *when*: a new picture, cursor or scroll offset must not
 * re-render the score view. During playback those change on every note, and a
 * re-render per note was measured at 7% of the JavaScript thread.
