/**
 * Sign in or create an account, as the whole of a place somebody went to in
 * order to do it — building_blocks_rn's `LoginPage`, the web `LoginPage`'s
 * counterpart: the app's name, a heading that follows the form's mode, the
 * form, its own scrolling and keyboard avoidance.
 *
 * **Page or modal is the family's rule, as on the web.** Somewhere a reader
 * *navigates to* in order to sign in — Settings' Account pane while signed
 * out, the Projects window's Connect pane — is this page. Where an account is
 * needed in the middle of something else (a gated list, the credit balance),
 * `SignInModal` opens over that screen instead, and signing in leaves the
 * reader where they were.
 *
 * Both places today are the detail pane of a split view, which has cleared
 * the screen's edges already: inside one (`useEmbedded`) the page clears
 * none, and as a screen of its own it clears the sides and bottom the one
 * rule names (`useSafeEdgeList`), leaving the top to the navigator — the same
 * division `ScreenScaffold` makes.
