/**
 * Adding one generated track to the open score.
 *
 * A prompt and an instrument, and nothing else — everything the new part has to
 * agree with is taken from the score by `buildGenerateTrackRequest`. Offering
 * length, key, time signature or tempo as fields would let somebody ask for a
 * track that cannot line up with the music it accompanies, and the result is
 * unusable rather than merely different.
