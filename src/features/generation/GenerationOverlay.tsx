/**
 * The row that says a job owns this score — a generation, or the
 * transcription of a recording — while the notes it writes appear in the
 * score above.
 *
 * A generation is a job, not a request that resolves: `POST /jobs` returns as
 * soon as the row exists and the work happens afterwards — and the work is
 * streamed, part by part, into the score. So this is a strip rather than a
 * cover: the score is the point, and a reader who opened the project to watch
 * it must be able to see it. What must not happen underneath is an edit or a
 * play, and neither can — the store's edit lock refuses content commands, the
 * score's touch handlers are dropped, and the transport's Play is disabled.
 * The strip is what tells the reader why.
 *
 * Cancel is offered because it is cheap and honest: cancelling writes `ready`,
 * and the running job discards its result when it next looks — including
 * between chunks of a long one. The notes written so far stay.
