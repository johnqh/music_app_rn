/**
 * Volume and pan are drawn as the things they are.
 *
 * Both were the library `Slider` before this — one control for two different
 * questions — and the two ways that reads wrongly are what these pin. A level
 * needs its groove visible behind the fill, or a quiet track is a short bar
 * floating in space with nothing to say how much further it goes. And pan is a
 * *position*, so it fills from the middle and reads out which side: a bar
 * growing from the left said "40% of maximum pan", which is not a thing.
