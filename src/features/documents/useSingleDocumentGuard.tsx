/**
 * Asks before opening a document would throw another one's work away.
 *
 * Under a tab bar one project is open at a time, so opening a document
 * closes the one already open (`DocumentList`'s `single`). The list closes
 * without asking, as it always has — only a caller has a person to ask — so
 * every way of opening a document on those platforms goes through `guard`.
 *
 * **Saved first, asked second.** A document with somewhere to live, a file
 * or a project, is written before anything is asked: its pending work is
 * then not at risk, and a question about it would be one the app could have
 * answered itself. What is left to ask about is work with nowhere to go — a
 * score never saved, or one whose save failed. The decision is music_lib's
 * `decideQuit`, the one Android's Back asks (`UnsavedQuitGuard`), and the
 * prompt is drawn in the same `ConfirmSheet` with the same copy.
 *
 * Where several documents may be open this asks nothing and runs the action.
