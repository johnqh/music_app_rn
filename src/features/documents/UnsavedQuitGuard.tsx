/**
 * Android's Back button must not throw away work without asking.
 *
 * The editor is the stack's `initialRouteName`, so there is nothing to pop
 * there and Back finishes the activity. Reproduced on a Pixel 9 Pro XL: write
 * two notes, the title bar reads "Unsaved", press Back — straight to the
 * launcher — relaunch, and the score is empty with no prompt having been
 * shown. The autosave debounce is the window that work lived in, and Back is
 * outside it: `AppState` flushes on *background*, which a finished activity
 * does not reliably reach.
 *
 * **The decision is music_lib's, not this component's.** `decideQuit` sits in
 * `unsaved-guard.ts` beside the `decideClose` a tab's × already uses, and both
 * answer the same `CloseDecision`. A second statement of "what counts as
 * unsaved" is exactly the kind that drifts — this asks the guard and draws the
 * answer in the `ConfirmSheet` the tab bar draws it in, with the same
 * `document.unsaved*` copy.
 *
 * `decideQuit` rather than `decideClose`, because Back at the root is a **quit**
 * and not a tab close: it asks about every open document at once, which is what
 * its doc comment and `DocumentList.unsaved` were both written for and what
 * nothing had called until now. Three prompts in a row is how somebody taps
 * "discard" on the one they meant to keep.
 *
 * Registered through `useFocusEffect`, which is the whole of "do not hijack
 * Back anywhere else": `BackHandler` subscriptions are global and run newest
 * first, so a listener left registered while Settings or Docs is on top would
 * swallow the pop that should take the reader back to the editor. Losing focus
 * removes it and React Navigation's own handler pops as it always did. An open
 * sheet needs no allowance either — a React Native `Modal` is a dialog holding
 * the window's focus, so Android hands Back to its `onRequestClose` and these
 * listeners never run.
 *
 * iOS and macOS have no hardware Back. `BackHandler.addEventListener` is a
 * no-op there rather than an error, so this costs them a subscription and
 * nothing else, and there is no platform branch to keep in step.
