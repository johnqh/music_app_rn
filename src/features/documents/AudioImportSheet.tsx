/**
 * Importing a recording as a project.
 *
 * Nothing is analysed here. The file is handed to the server, which separates
 * it and transcribes each part, so this picks a file and uploads it. The
 * models and the weights that used to make this the heaviest screen in the
 * web app all live in `midi_transcriber_api`.
 *
 * **Choosing the file is the whole of it.** The OS picker opens the moment
 * this is asked to open, as every other import on the menu does, and the
 * recording is sent as soon as one is chosen. There used to be a dialog in
 * between — the file's name, what would happen, a Transcribe button — which
 * asked the reader to confirm the thing they had just done. There is nothing
 * to decide in it: no tempo, no options, and the project that opens next is
 * where the result is watched arriving.
 *
 * **The picker opens whatever the answer is going to be.** Every format on
 * the Import list opens the file picker, and one that answered with a
 * message instead read as the one that was broken. So a recording is chosen
 * first even where it cannot be transcribed, and *then* the reader is told
 * why — nothing has been uploaded at that point, so nothing has been wasted
 * but a choice, and needing to sign in is a different thing to be told than
 * needing a server.
 *
 * The other thing still said is that the recording is on its way, while it
 * is: an upload takes seconds and a screen that does nothing for that long
 * reads as a tap that missed.
 *
 * **The recording is uploaded by path, not by bytes.** React Native's `Blob`
 * cannot be constructed from an `ArrayBuffer`, so reading a recording in order
 * to send it is not possible — and would mean holding a whole audio file in
 * memory if it were. `MusicClient.transcribeAudio` takes an `UploadableFile`
 * for exactly this: the browser passes its `File`, native passes
 * `{ uri, name, type }` and RN's networking layer streams it.
