/**
 * The editing bar, mirroring the web app's — control for control.
 *
 * Same groups in the same order, divided the same way: tracks, then note value
 * with its dotted/triplet modifiers, then accidentals, then articulation and
 * ornament with the tie beside them, then the marks and modes that act on a
 * selection, then the clipboard, then quantize, then voice, then the rare
 * actions behind a menu. Zoom, layout, pitch display and the inspector toggle
 * sit **outside the scroller**, pinned to the right, for the reason the web
 * pins them: they change how you look at the score rather than the score
 * itself, and they were the first things to disappear behind the horizontal
 * scroll.
 *
 * **Several choices are a picker, not a row of chips**, and that is the single
 * biggest difference from what this file used to be. Six note values, five
 * accidentals, five articulations, five ornaments and four quantize grids came
 * to twenty-five chips — a bar three screens wide, where the web's is one. Each
 * of those is a `ToolbarSelect` with one glyph on the trigger and the words in
 * the sheet, exactly as the web draws its `Select`s, and for the same reason:
 * five near-identical marks are unreadable as a row of 18px glyphs.
 *
 * **Every action is `music_editing`'s.** `chooseDuration`, `changeAccidental`,
 * `toggleTie` and the rest each enforce rules about a score — a hairpin needs
 * two notes, a fermata reads whether the whole selection already has one — and
 * those rules belong in the library, not in a toolbar. This file decides only
 * what is offered, in what order, and when it is available.
 *
 * **Availability is music_editing's `selectToolbarAvailability`**, the same
 * function the web bar reads, so the two cannot disagree about when a
 * glissando can be written. It used to be copied from the web by hand, thirty
 * `canEdit && …` expressions that agreed only because nobody had changed
 * either bar since — and the More menu had already parted: only its Glissando
 * entry knew about the transport, so Add Bar, Delete Bar and Enter Lyrics were
 * live mid-playback and did nothing. The same goes for the few controls that
 * are more than one call: Insert Note (`insertDefaultNoteAtCaret`), quantize
 * (`quantizeSelectionToGrid`), the More menu (`EDITOR_MORE_ACTIONS` /
 * `runMoreAction`), the add-track answers (`addTrackChoices` /
 * `runAddTrackChoice`) and the edit modes (`EDIT_MODE_OPTIONS`).
