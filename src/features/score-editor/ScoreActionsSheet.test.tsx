/**
 * The long-press menu — where cut, copy, paste, clear and delete live now.
 *
 * Two things here are the whole reason it is a menu rather than four buttons on
 * the editing bar. It **names its subject**, because Delete means three
 * different edits depending on whether a track, a span of bars or a run of notes
 * is selected. And it offers **Clear beside Delete**, which the bar never did
 * because the action did not exist: a cleared bar keeps its number and its
 * markings, a deleted one takes the rest of the score up with it.
 *
 * The rules — which entries are live, what the header counts — are
 * music_editing's `scoreContextMenuModel`, tested there. These render the
 * model, so what is pinned here is that the sheet draws what it is handed; the
 * web app's `ScoreContextMenu.test.tsx` asserts the same about its menu.
