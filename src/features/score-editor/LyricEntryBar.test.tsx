/**
 * Typing words under a melody.
 *
 * The rules here are the reason this is a bar and not a property field, and
 * every one of them is invisible to types. **Space** ends a word; **hyphen**
 * ends a syllable *within* one, which is what draws the trailing hyphen and
 * fills MusicXML's `<syllabic>`; the join is *derived* from those keystrokes
 * rather than asked for, because a writer knows they are mid-word.
 *
 * The rules are music_editing's (`lyricEntryStep`, tested there). The native
 * bar watches the *text* rather than key events, because a typed space on a
 * phone is a character in the field and not a key anything can cancel — so what
 * these cover is that watching the text reaches the same rules the web's key
 * handler does, including a separator typed anywhere in the syllable.
