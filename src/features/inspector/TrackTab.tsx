/**
 * The active track's properties — the web inspector's Track tab.
 *
 * Reflects and invokes only. The rules the actions enforce (carrying notes into
 * a new instrument's compass, refusing to delete the last track, resolving a
 * drum kit from a catalogue value, trimming a name and refusing a blank one,
 * snapping a mix value onto the mixer's step) are rules about a score, which is
 * why they live in `music_editing` — and the track slice picks each edit's undo
 * label itself from `commandLabel`, so this tab passes none. It used to pass
 * its own words (`inspector.renameTrack`, `inspector.mixChange`…), which is how
 * the same edit came to read differently in the undo history depending on
 * which app made it.
 *
 * The name is a **draft committed on blur** — dispatching per keystroke makes
 * every letter its own undo entry — and it is re-seeded when the track changes,
 * so switching tracks does not carry a half-typed name across. When
 * `renameTrack` declines (blank, or unchanged) the field goes back to the name
 * the track has, as the web's does.
