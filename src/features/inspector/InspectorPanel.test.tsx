/**
 * The property sheet's tabs: the web's four, plus this app's Unplugged.
 *
 * The order and the opening tab are music_types' (`INSPECTOR_TABS`) and
 * music_editing's (`defaultInspectorTab`), shared with the web: Score, Track, Note, Bar — and a
 * fresh selection opens the tab it is *of*, Track when nothing is selected,
 * because the Note and Bar tabs are an empty state until something is. This
 * panel listed Track, Note, Bar, Score and always opened on Track, so a reader
 * moving between the apps found the tabs in a different place and tapped a note
 * to find its properties one tab away.
 *
 * The tabs are driven through the control rather than by pressing their labels.
 * `SegmentedTabs` is a real `UISegmentedControl` on iOS — which is the platform
 * jest simulates — and its labels are a `values` prop on a native view, not
 * `Text` a query can find or a `Pressable` a test can press.
