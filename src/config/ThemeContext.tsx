/**
 * Which colour scheme is in force, and how to change it.
 *
 * Split from `ThemeVarsProvider` because they answer different questions: this
 * one resolves the *preference* and that one applies whatever is decided.
 * Keeping them apart is what lets a settings screen change the theme without
 * knowing anything about design tokens.
 *
 * The preference itself is a device pref (`useDevicePrefs`), loaded and saved
 * with the others by music_lib's `bindDevicePrefs`. It used to be read and
 * written here under a key of its own, a second persistence path for one of
 * six settings that all have to survive a relaunch the same way.
 *
 * `system` resolves through React Native's `useColorScheme`, which reports OS
 * changes as they happen — so a device that goes dark at sunset takes the app
 * with it, without a relaunch.
