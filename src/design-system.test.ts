/**
 * The interface is drawn from the design system, and says so in the source.
 *
 * `@sudobility/components-rn` on the Swiss theme is what makes this app and
 * the web app one product: a colour written as a literal does not follow
 * light and dark, and a control built from a bare `Pressable` inherits none
 * of what the library's carry — the tokens, the touch target, the pressed
 * answer, the assistive press a Mac reaches a control by. Both were found by
 * eye, after they shipped: a tab strip that stayed a light band across a dark
 * editor, title-bar glyphs in white beside a title in the theme's ink.
 *
 * Neither types nor a render test sees any of it, so the source is scanned —
 * the way `legibility.test.ts` scans for small text. Every exemption below is
 * a decision with its reason beside it; add to a list only with one.
