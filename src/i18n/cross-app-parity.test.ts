/**
 * The two apps say the same thing, or say why not.
 *
 * `music_app` and this app are one product, and 798 of their translation keys
 * are the same key. Nothing shares them: the libraries hold no strings in any
 * language — that rule is what lets a Chinese reader get Chinese documentation
 * rather than a library's idea of English — so the copy is two files that drift
 * the moment one is edited, silently, because both apps still render.
 *
 * `docs-parity.test.ts` pinned the documentation prose that way. This pins
 * everything else, in four checks that each catch a different failure:
 *
 * - **Where the English agrees, the Chinese must agree too.** A key whose
 *   English is identical in both apps and whose Chinese is not is a *translation*
 *   fork with no design behind it — two translators' words for one string. Six
 *   of these had accumulated (`断音`/`断奏` for staccato, `临时记号`/`变音记号`
 *   for an accidental, and four more), and none of them is a decision anybody
 *   made. There is deliberately no exemption list here: if the English is one
 *   string, so is the Chinese.
 *
 * - **The English must agree unless it is listed below.** Where the two apps
 *   genuinely say different things — a document is a project on the web, the
 *   native transport shows a percentage the web shows in a separate indicator —
 *   the exemption is written down with its reason, the way
 *   `locale-parity.test.ts`'s `SHARED_BY_DESIGN` is. A new disagreement fails
 *   until somebody decides it is one.
 *
 * - **One string, one key.** The same English under a key only the web has and
 *   a key only this app has is one label keyed twice — `editor.octave` beside
 *   `inspector.octave` was twenty-eight of those — and the two drift the moment
 *   one is edited, invisibly to the check above, which compares key by key.
 *   Rename to one key set, or list the key in `SAME_WORDS_DIFFERENT_KEYS` with
 *   the reason the two are not one label.
 *
 * - **Every key `music_types` publishes must resolve in both apps and both
 *   languages.** `ACCIDENTAL_OPTIONS` and friends carry an i18n *key*, not a
 *   word, so a picker built from them prints the raw key when the host has no
 *   string for it. That is exactly what the web's ornament picker did: the
 *   library asks for `ornament.invertedMordent` and the locale carried the
 *   model's kebab-case `ornament.inverted-mordent`, so the menu read
 *   "ornament.invertedMordent" and no test could see it — a key that is missing
 *   from *both* locales is perfectly consistent.
 *
 * Cross-repo, and only in this direction: the web app's suite must not need a
 * checkout of this one. If the sibling is not there the tests skip rather than
 * fail, because a CI job with one repo checked out has not broken anything.
