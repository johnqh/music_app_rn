 * A choice made in Settings is a device pref, remembered across launches; it
 * used to be `i18n.changeLanguage` alone, which lasted until the app was next
 * killed. A stored language this build does not ship is ignored rather than
 * applied, since i18next would silently fall back to English for it.
 *
 * **The rule is music_types' `preferredLanguage`; only the list is this app's.**
 * This used to compare the stored language against `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` whole,
 * which meant a stored `zh-Hans` — a perfectly ordinary BCP 47 tag, and what a
 * device reports — matched nothing and fell through to the device's own
 * language. A reader who had chosen Chinese on an English phone was quietly
 * given English back, for as long as the choice stayed stored. The web app had
 * matched by language subtag all along; two copies of one rule, and only one of
 * them right.
