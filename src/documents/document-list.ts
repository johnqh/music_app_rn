/**
 * The documents that are open, and which one is in front.
 *
 * A plain observable rather than a zustand store, because it holds documents
 * whose own stores are zustand — nesting one inside another makes every score
 * edit look like a change to the list. The list changes when a document opens,
 * closes or comes to the front, which is rare; the score changes constantly.
 *
 * `activeId` falls back to the first document whenever it names one that is not
 * open, so "one document is active" and "the active document was closed" need
 * no reconciliation step — the same rule music_editing's `selectActiveTrackId`
 * follows, for the same reason.
 *
 * **The list owns a document's lifetime.** What is attached when a document
 * opens — the device prefs mirrored into its store — is detached when it
 * closes, and the store's saver is disposed with it. A document that closed
 * but kept a subscription to the prefs store would be written to forever by a
 * store nobody can see; one that kept its debounce timer would save a tab that
 * no longer exists.
 *
 * **Each document keeps its own caret.** There is one playback position — only
 * one transport plays at a time, so there is only ever one playhead to disagree
 * about — and it belongs to the document in front. music_lib's stores are
 * therefore built *not* to move it when they open (`resetPosition` false):
 * opening a document into a tab used to send the caret of whatever the reader
 * was looking at back to bar 1. The list is what knows which document is in
 * front, so it banks the leaving document's tick and puts the arriving one's
 * back — or bar 1, for a document that has never been in front.
 *
 * **And its scroll offset.** A tab's editor is a fresh component per document,
 * so its score view opened at the top whatever the restored caret said — pages
 * away from it on a long score. The view banks its offset here when it goes
 * away (`bankScroll`) and reads it back when it opens (`scrollOffset`); a
 * document never scrolled answers null, which the view reads as "bring the
 * caret into view". View state rather than document state, so it lives here
 * beside the caret and not in the store, which would mark the document dirty.

 * 1.1 / 0:00.0 with the music it had reached thrown away; `pause()` leaves the
 * position where it is for `swapCaret` to bank a line later. That is also why
 * this is called from `leaveFront` rather than being left to the leaving
 * editor's player binding as it unmounts, which happens after the arriving
 * tab's caret has been restored and would report over it.
 *
 * **Only when this document is the one playing.** The player is app-wide, so a
 * tab that is not the one sounding has no music of its own to stop — and the
 * engine's pause reports "paused" from a stopped transport too, which would
 * leave a tab that was only ever sitting there looking paused.
 *
 * Here rather than in the composition root that wires it (`App.tsx`), because
 * that is a React component and this is the part a test can hold. The player is
 * taken structurally, so this module still depends on nothing that makes sound.
