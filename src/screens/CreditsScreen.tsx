/**
 * Credits — the balance, and what a generation costs.
 *
 * **Quoted, not calculated.** One credit per bar per instrument, which is what
 * the server bills, and the quote says "about": the server charges what the
 * model actually produced, which agrees whenever generation returns the length
 * asked for and is otherwise smaller. A quote that could be exceeded would be
 * worse than none.
 *
 * The web app's store page comes from `@sudobility/consumables_pages`, which
 * has no React Native port; purchasing therefore is not offered here rather
 * than half-offered. What is shown is the balance, the rate and the coupon
 * form, which is the one way to add credits from here — and the
 * balance really is shown now: this screen claimed it in its own doc while
 * rendering only the rate, so the one number somebody opens it for was the one
 * thing missing.
 *
 * The balance comes from `ConsumablesApiClient`, which needs no purchase SDK —
 * see `useCreditBalance`.
