/**
 * What the projects screen offers when there is no account behind it.
 *
 * The project list needs a server and a sign-in; **importing a file does not**,
 * and putting the two behind one gate is what made a signed-out install unable
 * to open anything at all. MIDI, MusicXML and a tracker module are decoded on
 * the device and become a local document, and this app has no auth gate over
 * the editor precisely because a local document needs no account — so the
 * Import control has to survive both empty states. Audio is the exception and
 * is allowed to say it cannot run, because it is transcribed server-side.
