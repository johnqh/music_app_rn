/**
 * The documentation screen, master–detail over `DOCS_TOPICS`.
 *
 * Two things here are worth pinning. The first is that the topic list is the
 * shared structure and not a hand-kept copy: a topic added for the web that
 * never appears here is documentation a reader on this platform simply cannot
 * reach, and nothing fails when that happens.
 *
 * The second is the live-data widget. The instrument section is *built from the
 * GM catalogue* rather than described in prose, because prose about a table is
 * a copy of that table and goes stale the first time an instrument is
 * regrouped. If the widget silently stopped rendering, the section would still
 * look complete — a heading, a summary, and nothing under it — so the test
 * asserts a catalogue row actually appears under the topic that declares it.
 *
 * Expected text is resolved through i18next rather than matched as a raw key:
 * `renderWithApp` starts i18n with the real English resources, so the screen
 * renders translated copy and asserting on `docs.editor.title` would find
 * nothing. Resolving the key keeps the assertion about *which* copy is wired to
 * the topic — this component's job — without hard-coding English into the test.
