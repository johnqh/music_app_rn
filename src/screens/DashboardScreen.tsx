/**
 * Projects on the server — the web app's dashboard.
 *
 * Every import in the web app ends in `newProject(...)` and a navigation, which
 * is why they live on the dashboard rather than in the editor's own title bar:
 * an Import menu inside a project could only throw you out of the project you
 * had open. The same reasoning holds here.
 *
 * The *project list* requires a server and an account, and says which is
 * missing rather than showing an empty list either way. **Import does not, and
 * used to be gated behind both.** MIDI, MusicXML and a tracker module are
 * decoded on the device by `useImport` and become a local document; nothing
 * about them needs a row on a server. They were inside `ProjectList`, which
 * only renders for a signed-in user with a server configured — and since this
 * app opens straight into a scratch document, the empty state in `EditorScreen`
 * that also carries them is never reached. Measured on Android: a signed-out
 * install could not open a file of any kind, on a build whose whole premise
 * (`App.tsx` has no auth gate) is that a local document needs no account.
 * Audio is the one exception and stays behind the gate, because it is
 * transcribed server-side.
