/**
 * Settings, as master and detail — the account first, then what the account
 * holds, then what belongs to the device. The split view is
 * `sudojo_app_rn`'s (`SplitViewContainer`): a list with its own navigation
 * bar, and the chosen section beside it under a bar of its own.
 *
 * **What is listed depends on who is signed in.** Signed out there is the
 * account — which is then the sign-in form — and Appearance. Signed in there
 * is everything the web dashboard offers, in its order: Credits (which holds
 * the coupon form), Credit history, API keys, and Manage coupons for a site
 * administrator. The account's sections are not listed for somebody with no
 * account: each would be a page saying only "sign in", under the one entry
 * that does exactly that.
 *
 * **Appearance is last**, as the one section that is about the app rather
 * than the person.
 *
 * Docs, Resources and Community are tabs where there is a tab bar. Without
 * one this screen is still the way to them, so they are listed after the
 * sections and leave the screen rather than fill the pane.
