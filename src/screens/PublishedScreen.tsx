 * The score, and the two things a visitor can do with it.

 * **Listening is the whole point of a public page** — "anyone can listen, no
 * account needed" is what the community screen promises — and this screen
 * showed the notation with no way to hear it. Its own component because the
 * player must not be bound before the snapshot has arrived: a hook cannot be
 * skipped, and loading a null score into the player is not a state worth
 * modelling.
 *
 * **The page has a store of its own**, an unsaved document over the snapshot's
 * score, because `bindPlayer` binds a store: it is where the transport state and
 * the load progress are mirrored, and where a failed play is reported — to the
 * app's toast queue, like every other store here. The web's published page had
 * the opposite bug, binding the app's singleton store and so playing whatever
 * the editor last had open. Nothing saves it: an unsaved origin has nowhere to
 * write, and nothing on this page edits.
 *
 * Sharing is the other half: a page whose whole purpose is being passed on
 * should offer the system share sheet rather than making somebody copy a URL
 * out of a browser they are not in.
