/**
 * RNW's Composition host emulates RAF with immediate UI dispatcher posts.
 * Bound frame work to the display cadence so playback cannot flood that queue.
 * A timeout also keeps working across scroll/layout transitions.
 *
 * Two things about RNW's timers decide the shape of this:
 *
 * - **A fixed 16.7ms delay is a 32fps clock.** Timers are `DispatcherQueueTimer`
 *   intervals, truncated to whole milliseconds and fired on the system tick
 *   (~15.6ms), so 16ms lands on the second tick. Each frame is therefore
 *   aimed at a grid, `FRAME_MS` after the last one ran: a request made just
 *   after a frame waits ~15ms (one tick), one made late waits next to nothing.
 * - **Every timer is a UI-thread post** to create and another to fire. The
 *   cursor, the canvas's paint, the player's lit-notes ticker and the keyboard
 *   each ask for frames, so one timer serves every request made before it
 *   fires, as a browser's frame does.
