/**
 * The notation glyphs, replayed from the description the web toolbar draws.
 *
 * Two things here are silent when wrong, which is why they are pinned rather
 * than eyeballed. `currentColor` is an SVG idea `react-native-svg` does not
 * resolve: leave it unsubstituted and the glyph stops following the theme
 * without anything throwing. And `fill="none"` is how the authored shapes
 * express an *outline* — an open notehead, a hollow bracket — so overwriting it
 * with the icon colour fills those glyphs solid, which reads as a different
 * musical symbol entirely.
 *
 * The third check is structural: `renderShape` ends in `default: return null`,
 * so a shape kind it does not handle vanishes with no error. Counting emitted
 * elements against the authored data is what turns that into a failure.
 *
 * Props are read with `UNSAFE_queryAllByType` rather than from `toJSON()`
 * deliberately — by the time a shape reaches the host tree react-native-svg has
 * processed `#ff0000` into `{payload, type}` and `"none"` into `null`, so
 * asserting there would pin that library's internal colour encoding instead of
 * this file's substitution.
