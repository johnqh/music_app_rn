/**
 * A row in a list that is pressed to choose it — a project, a template, a
 * format to import — and says so under the pointer.
 *
 * These rows were plain `Pressable`s with one background, which is right on
 * a phone: a finger covers what it touches, and the press is felt. On a
 * desktop the pointer hovers before it clicks, and a row that does not
 * change under it reads as a label rather than a control — and a click that
 * changes nothing on the way down reads as a click that missed, which is
 * what it looked like while a project took a moment to open.
 *
 * Hover and press are held as state rather than read from `Pressable`'s
 * style callback, so the classes stay NativeWind's and follow the theme.
 * `onHoverIn`/`onHoverOut` are never called where there is no pointer, so a
 * phone sees the pressed state alone.
