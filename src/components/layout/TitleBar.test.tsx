/**
 * The title bar.
 *
 * Its rule is that a control is **absent rather than dead** when it cannot
 * work: Snapshots and Print each depend on something the document may not have
 * — a project row, or a print service — and a button that is present and
 * refuses invites a tap that can only fail. There is no Generate at all: an
 * open project offers Generate Again on the Score tab, as the web does.
