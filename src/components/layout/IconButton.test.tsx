/**
 * The bar's icon button.
 *
 * Small, and load-bearing in two ways. A toggle must report `selected` to the
 * accessibility layer as well as tinting — the tint says it only to somebody
 * looking. And the class strings must be *whole*: Tailwind extracts classes by
 * scanning source text, so an interpolated variant never appears complete in
 * the file and is silently never generated. That fails quietly — the colours
 * still work, the layout does not.
