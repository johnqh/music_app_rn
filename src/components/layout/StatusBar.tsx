/**
 * The bottom status strip, mirroring the web app's.
 *
 * Same content and same order: what is selected on the left, and the
 * validation issues on the right.
 *
 * The left half used to say the active track's name and a bar/track count,
 * which is not what this comment claimed and not what the web app shows. Both
 * were also answers you already had: the track's name is painted into the
 * canvas gutter beside every system, by the renderer both apps share. What was
 * missing is the one thing a status strip is for — what you have selected —
 * and `selectionSummaryLabel` is music_types', so the two apps read a
 * selection with the same function and differ only in the words.
 *
 * The issue count is the one control here that does anything, and it is the
 * right place for it: an issue is something the score *has*, so it belongs
 * beside the other things the strip reports rather than among the tools. It
 * says nothing at all when the score is clean, which is almost always — a
 * permanent "0 issues" is a permanent invitation to stop reading the strip.
