/**
 * The editor, laid out as the web app lays it out.
 *
 * Title bar (where there is no menu bar to carry it instead — see
 * `hasMenuBar()` below), then the score with the inspector beside it, then the
 * transport, the keyboard and the status strip. The web app's `AppLayout` has
 * exactly this order, and matching it is the point: the two are the same
 * product, and somebody who knows where the transport is should not have to
 * look for it.
 *
 * The inspector is a right-hand column, as it is on the web, and on a touch
 * device it **trades places with the canvas track gutter**: shown, the gutter
 * is off; hidden, the gutter is back. See `TRADES_GUTTER_FOR_INSPECTOR`.
 *
 * It used to be a column only above 760×600 and a strip beneath the score
 * below that, which is a rule that made sense while a portrait tablet was
 * possible. Every device here is landscape-only now, and in landscape a column
 * is the cheap arrangement and a strip is the expensive one: height is what is
 * scarce (the title bar, tabs, editing bar, transport, keyboard and status
 * strip are all fixed rows and only the score absorbs the rest), and a column
 * costs none of it. The strip arrangement was taking the one thing the phone
 * could not spare.

 * 874×402 — 756 inside the safe area — a 320pt inspector plus that 220pt
 * column left **216pt of music**: one bar per system. The arithmetic simply
 * does not close on a phone, and it does not close on a tablet either once the
 * reader has opened the panel they opened it to use.
 *
 * So they trade: inspector shown → no gutter, inspector hidden → gutter. (The
 * gutter at its full width, that is. Narrowed to the instrument icon it is
 * 40pt, which the arithmetic does close on, so that mode stays: see
 * `trackInfoShown`.) What
 * the gutter was telling you is exactly what the inspector's Track tab tells
 * you — the name, the instrument, mute and solo — so nothing is lost while it
 * is off, and the active track is still changed by tapping a staff, which
 * was never the gutter's job.
 *
 * **macOS keeps both**, which is why this is a platform question and not a
