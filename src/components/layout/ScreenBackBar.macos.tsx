/**
 * The way back out of a pushed screen — macOS, where nothing else offers one.
 *
 * Every screen but the editor is pushed onto a native stack with
 * `headerShown: true`, and on this react-native-macos / react-native-screens
 * build that header is **not drawn at all** — measured on the accessibility
 * tree: Settings and Docs expose their content and no back control of any kind,
 * to the pointer or to VoiceOver. There is no swipe-back on a Mac either, so a
 * pushed screen is a one-way trip: the app has to be relaunched to get out of
 * it.
 *
 * That was invisible while nothing navigated anywhere — which is exactly the
 * state Settings was in. Making it reachable makes this reachable too, so the
 * body of each screen draws the control the header would have.
 *
 * `canGoBack` rather than always: the editor is the stack's first route and
 * renders no scaffold, but a screen shown as a root would otherwise offer a
 * back that does nothing.
