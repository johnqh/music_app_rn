/**
 * Whatever a split view shows in its detail panel can be scrolled.
 *
 * The panel is as tall as the screen leaves it, and what it shows is as tall
 * as it is: a form, a list, a page of prose. `SplitPanel` cannot supply the
 * scrolling itself — half of what it holds are lists that virtualize, and a
 * list inside a scroll view measures nothing and draws nothing — so each pane
 * brings its own, and this is what notices when one does not.
 *
 * Source-scanned, like `screens-reachable`: a rendered test would prove one
 * pane scrolls, where this proves there is no pane that cannot. It reads each
 * split view for the components it puts in its detail panel, and each of
 * those for a scrolling container — its own, or `ScreenScaffold`'s.
