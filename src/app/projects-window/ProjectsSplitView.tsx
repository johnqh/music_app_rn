/**
 * Projects, as master and detail: a list and whichever pane it has
 * selected — see `paneKey.ts` for the set and `ProjectsSidebar.tsx` for
 * why Connect and My Projects are one slot, not two. The split view is
 * `sudojo_app_rn`'s (`SplitViewContainer`), as its Techniques tab uses it:
 * the list under a navigation bar of its own, and the chosen pane beside it
 * under another.
 *
 * One component in two places. On macOS and Windows it is the content of the
 * separate Projects window (`ProjectsWindow.tsx`); on iOS and Android it is
 * the Projects tab (`ProjectsScreen.tsx`). What differs is what happens once
 * a project is open, so that is the caller's: `onProjectOpened` and
 * `onOpenCredits`.
 *
 * **Left by opening a project, never by anything drawn here.** New,
 * Template, an existing project chosen from My Projects, and every format
 * under Import all funnel through `onProjectOpened` — on a desktop it
 * focuses the main window and dismisses this one, under a tab bar it pushes
 * the editor — so picking a project always lands the reader somewhere they
 * can see it. Signing in is deliberately not on that list: it only swaps
 * which slot the sidebar's first item is.
