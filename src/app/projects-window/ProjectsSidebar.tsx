 * The Projects split view's list — its primary panel.

 * slot says Connect and opens the sign-in pane; signed in, it says My
 * Projects and opens the list — `ProjectsSplitView` decides which by
 * `signedIn` alone, so the two can never both be selectable, and a reader
 * who was looking at Connect the moment they finished signing in lands on
 * My Projects rather than a pane that no longer applies to them.
