/**
 * Mobile is landscape-only, on every device.
 *
 * A system of music is wide: a portrait phone shows about two bars of it, and a
 * portrait tablet is no better once the inspector column and the track gutter
 * are both accounted for. So iOS, iPadOS and Android are all landscape, and the
 * layout code is allowed to assume it.
 *
 * This is declarative on both platforms and therefore invisible to every other
 * test in the suite — nothing renders a manifest. It is also exactly the kind of
 * thing that regresses silently: the app simply rotates one day and the score
 * gets narrow. Android had that bug. `AndroidManifest.xml` declared
 * `sensorLandscape` and `MainActivity.onCreate` then called
 * `setRequestedOrientation` with `SCREEN_ORIENTATION_UNSPECIFIED` on any device
 * over `sw600dp`, which is a runtime override of the manifest and wins — so the
 * tablet emulator launched in portrait while the manifest said it could not.
 *
 * `sensorLandscape` rather than `landscape`: both landscape directions are
 * upright for this app, so a device turned 180° should follow rather than show
 * the music upside down. And rather than `userLandscape`, which obeys the
 * system rotation lock — a reader with rotation locked would be pinned to one
 * of the two, which is a setting about portrait/landscape being answered for an
 * app that has no portrait.
