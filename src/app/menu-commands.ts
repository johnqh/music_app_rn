/**
 * The desktop menu bar (macOS and Windows), as events.
 *
 * Every command a desktop window offers instead of the on-screen title bar:
 * File's New/Open/Save/Save As/Print/Snapshots, Import and Export, and Edit's
 * Undo/Redo, plus the two navigation commands (Projects, Settings) a phone
 * reaches from the title bar and a desktop window reaches from a menu. `Print`
 * and `Snapshots` were AppKit's own unwired template items (`print:` on the
 * first responder, and nothing at all) until they had selectors of their own —
 * the same problem `file.new` and its siblings had: AppKit disables an item
 * whose selector nobody in the responder chain implements, and this is not an
 * `NSDocument` app, so nothing answered.
 *
 * Each platform owns its own menu — AppKit's storyboard on macOS, a Win32 menu
 * bar in `windows/MoosiacRN/MoosiacRN.cpp` on Windows — and JavaScript owns
 * what a command *does*, so each platform's app shell answers a click and
 * hands it to a small native module named `MoosiacMenuBridge`
 * (`AppDelegate.mm` on macOS, `MenuBridgeModule` on Windows) that turns it
 * into one JS event. This is the JS end of that, and it does not care which
 * native module answered — the two are declared under the same RN module
 * name for exactly that reason.
 *
 * iPadOS has the same menu (`ios/music_app_rn/AppDelegate.swift` and
 * `MoosiacMenuBridge.m`), alongside the title bar rather than instead of it.
 *
 * Absent on every other platform, and that is the whole guard: Android
 * and the tests have no such module, `emitter` stays null, and subscribing is
 * a no-op rather than a crash. Nothing here should be conditional on
 * `Platform.OS` — the module's presence is the honest test, and it keeps
 * working if a third platform ever grows a menu bar.
