/**
 * The tab bar in a desktop window: Projects, Community, Docs, Resources and
 * Settings, across the top.
 *
 * macOS and Windows. The same five tabs, the same screens and the same route
 * names as `MainTabs.tsx`, so a desktop window is arranged as a tablet is —
 * one window, the tabs along its top, and under them each tab's own split
 * view. The editor is pushed above this navigator (`Navigation.tsx`), so an
 * open project covers the bar and has the whole window.
 *
 * **The bar is drawn here, where the tablet's is the system's.** The native
 * navigator hands its tabs to a `UITabBarController` or a Material bar;
 * `react-native-screens` has no macOS or Windows half to hand them to, which
 * is the reason the desktop stack is the JS one too
 * (`createAppStackNavigator`). So this is the JS tab navigator with a bar of
 * its own, along the top because that is where a window keeps its
 * navigation — and where an iPad has kept its tab bar since iPadOS 18.
 *
 * There is no Back guard here, as there is under the mobile tabs: nothing on
 * a desktop is a Back button that finishes the app.
