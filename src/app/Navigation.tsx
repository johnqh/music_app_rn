/**
 * The app's screens, mirroring the web app's routes.
 *
 * The web is a router over `/:lang/...`; this is a navigator over the same
 * destinations — projects, editor, community, published, docs, resources,
 * settings, credits and sign-in. Matching the set is what makes the two the
 * same product; matching the *mechanism* would not, since a URL is not a thing
 * a phone has.
 *
 * **One arrangement, on every platform.** The five destinations that are
 * not a document are tabs (`MainTabs`), the app opens on them, and
 * everything else — the editor first among them — is pushed above the tab
 * bar, which is how an open project comes to have the whole screen. A
 * desktop window is arranged as a tablet is: one window, the tabs across
 * its top, a split view beneath. The arrangement without a tab bar is kept
 * for a platform that has none (`hasTabBar()`), which today is no platform
 * the app is built for.
 *
 * Native stack on iOS and Android, plain JS on macOS and Windows — see
 * `createAppStackNavigator` for why the split exists.
 *
 * **There is no auth gate.** The web app puts one above everything except
 * community and published pages; here the editor works on a local document with
 * no account at all, so the gate would refuse what the app is for. Screens that
 * genuinely need a server say so themselves.
