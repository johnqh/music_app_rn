/**
 * Component tests, beside the vitest suite rather than replacing it.
 *
 * Two runners because they answer different questions and neither does both
 * well. Vitest runs the plain-TypeScript half — the document model, the store
 * wiring, the platform adapters — under `node`, fast, with no React Native at
 * all. Jest with the React Native preset is what can actually *render* a
 * component: it has the babel transform for React Native's Flow-typed source,
 * which vitest's esbuild pipeline does not.
 *
 * The split is by extension, so there is nothing to remember: `*.test.ts` is
 * vitest's, `*.test.tsx` is jest's.
 *
 * @type {import('jest').Config}
