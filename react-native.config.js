/**
 * Which native dependency belongs to which platform.
 *
 * Two of them are platform-specific for the same underlying reason — a file
 * picker is a different control on every OS, and neither package pretends
 * otherwise:
 *
 * - `@react-native-documents/picker` wraps `UIDocumentPickerViewController` and
 *   Android's Storage Access Framework. Its podspec declares `:ios` only, so
 *   listing it for macOS would ask CocoaPods to install something that does not
 *   build there.
 * - `@moosiac/file-picker` is the Mac half — `NSOpenPanel` and `NSSavePanel`.
 *   It needs no entry here: it declares `macos` and nothing else in its own
 *   `react-native.config.js`, which is how a package says which platforms it
 *   has native code for. Repeating that here would *replace* its platform map
 *   rather than adding to it, and the entry would vanish from autolinking
 *   entirely — which is exactly what happened.
 *
 * `@react-native-community/slider` and
 * `@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control` need **no entry**, and
 * that is worth stating because adding one looks obviously right and is not.
 * Neither has a macOS implementation — both podspecs are `:ios, :visionos` —
 * so autolinking already leaves them out of the macOS Pods, exactly as it does
 * `react-native-screens`; each has a `.macos` variant in `src/` that a Mac
 * build resolves instead. Excluding the slider *here* actively broke Android:
 * this map **replaces** a package's own rather than merging into it, so the
 * entry took `sourceDir` with it and the `cmakeListsPath` the package declares
 * arrived at CMake as a bare relative path — `add_subdirectory given source
 * "src/main/jni/" which is not an existing directory`, and then
 * `react_codegen_RNCSlider ... is not built by this project`. A package that
 * declares its own platforms is one to leave alone.
 *
 * `react-native-screens` needs no entry: it publishes no macOS implementation,
 * so autolinking already leaves it out of the macOS Pods. What that *does* mean
 * is that the navigator has to be JS-backed on the Mac — see `Navigation.tsx`.

      is not what is on this machine, so every simulator run died at
      "Installing CocoaPods" with the real reason swallowed.

  codegen skips a library only when its config for the platform it generates,
  `ios`, is `null`. So `macos: null` alone reaches neither: the Mac app
  autolinked RNFirebase and the rest, and codegen listed their TurboModules in
  `RCTModuleProviders` with no class behind them, a fatal "Module provider
  RNFBAnalyticsModule cannot be found in the runtime" on a Debug launch.

  `RN_MACOS_BUILD=1` is set by `macos/Podfile` (for `pod install`) and
